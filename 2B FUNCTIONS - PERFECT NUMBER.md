# Exp.No:2b FUNCTIONS - MODULO
# AIM
To write a Python program to define a function that accepts two values and returns their modulo value.

# ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Read two numbers a and b from the user using input().
3. 3Convert the inputs to integers using int(). Define a function result(a, b) with the following steps:
4. Calculate the modulo using a % b and store it in a variable d. Print the result using a formatted string.
5. Call the function result(a, b) with the user inputs.
6. Terminate the program.

# PROGRAM
212223060113-Karnatam Bindu
```
def result(a,b):
  d=a%b
print(f"modulo is {d}")
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
```
